microreset
=========

A very small CSS reset. Because the others are over 1kb.

---

Why?
---
Because I want a reset that only takes care of the elements I **do** use, rather than every possible element I could but don't.

Also, it's small and small things are cute.

How?
---
Drop it into the top of your existing CSS file.

**Don't** bother including this externally. The performance penalty of another HTTP request defeats the purpose of using it.

Who?
---
This is for anyone else who just makes websites 'n' stuff, and wants a reset they can drop in with an imperceptible performance hit.

If you use it, feel free to add any elements you regularly use.
