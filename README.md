tinyreset
=========

A very tiny CSS style reset. Because the others are over 1kb.

---

Why?
---
Because I want a reset that only takes care of the elements I **do** use, rather than every possible element I could but don't.

Also, it's small and small things are cute.

How?
---
Drop it into the top of your existing CSS file.

**Don't** bother including this externally. The performance penalty of another HTTP request defeats the purpose of using it.

Who?
---
This is for anyone else who just makes websites, and wants a reset they can drop in with an imperceptible performance hit.

If you use it, feel free to fork the repo and add any elements you regularly use. 

If you do complex web graphics using WebGL or you're building the next Facebook, this isn't for you.
