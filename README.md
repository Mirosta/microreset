tinyreset
=========

A very tiny CSS style reset. Because the others are over 1kb.

---

Why?
---
Because I want a reset that only takes care of the elements I **do** use, rather than every possible element I could but don't.

Also, it's small and small things are cute.

Who?
---
This is for anyone else who just makes websites, and want a reset they can drop in without a noticable hit to performance.

If you do complex web graphics using WebGL or you're building the next Facebook, this isn't for you.
